# Qwixx game in React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Approach / techniques:

Functional React components, hooks, context, reducers, memo.

Some choices may feel a little superfluous, but I added them anyway because of learning purposes.
(eg. reusable hook for toggle state)

## To do:

- XX Show scores per color & total score
- XX throw dice
- XX add context for dice (no need for reducer & memo)
- XX add StartForm 
- XX let player change it's name
- XX add reusable hook for toggle state
- add reusable hook for input state
- switch player turn
- make last box clickable when: at least 5 boxes checked in same row.
- make 'lock' clickable when: last item is checked.
- add localStorage
- end game when two rows are closed or one player has 4 penalties.
