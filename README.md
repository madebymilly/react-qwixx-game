# Qwixx game in React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Approach / techniques:

Functional React components, hooks, context, reducers, memo.

## To do:

- XX Show scores per color & total score
- XX throw dice
- XX add context for dice (no need for reducer & memo)
- add StartForm
- switch player turn
- make last box clickable when: at least 5 boxes checked in same row.
- make 'lock' clickable when: last item is checked.
- add localStorage
- end game when two rows are closed or one player has 4 penalties.
